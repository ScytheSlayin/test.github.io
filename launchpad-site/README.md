# LaunchPad — Static Website Starter

A clean, mobile‑first, SEO‑ready static site you can deploy in minutes.

## Quick Start

1. **Download** the ZIP and unzip it.
2. Open `index.html` in your browser to preview locally.
3. Deploy to any static host:
   - **Netlify**: Drag the folder into the Netlify dashboard (or `netlify deploy`).
   - **GitHub Pages**: Create a repo, push these files, and enable Pages on the `main` branch (root).
   - **Vercel / Cloudflare Pages**: Import the repo and deploy without a build step.

## Customization

- Edit colors and spacing in `assets/css/styles.css` (CSS variables at the top).
- Update copy and sections in `index.html`.
- Set your real domain in `robots.txt` and `sitemap.xml` (replace `https://example.com`).

## Contact Form

The included form works out of the box on **Netlify** using _Netlify Forms_. If you host elsewhere, change the form `action` to your endpoint or a form service (e.g., Formspree).

## PWA

This template includes `manifest.webmanifest` and a simple `sw.js` to cache key assets. Browsers will allow “Add to Home Screen”.

## Accessibility

We use semantic HTML, focus outlines, and reduced‑motion defaults. Use tab to navigate and verify with your content.
